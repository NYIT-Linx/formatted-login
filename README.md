# formatted-login
for waleed to incorporate into the project, should be able to copy and paste with no problems

everything should be formatted, you may need to reset the constraints. you may not need the java class sine we are 
gonna use the login java class for the chatrooms instead but i still added it just in case.

as of 11/18 one of the pngs is missing so that is normal, im waiting for rav to adjust it as i got a transparency issue with it. once it is done i will test it and upload it here.
